This is the 1st project for the **Deep Learning** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101-cn-advanced)

The project used historical data for bike-sharing to predict the number of users in a day. 

The project used **numpy/pandas** and **Python** to build and train a network, it implemented **forward/backward propagation**, sigmoid function , and MSE(mean of squared error) loss function.

Here is the project file [Neural_Network_Prediction.ipynb](Neural_Network_Prediction.ipynb)
