# 神经网络预测 - Neural_Network_Prediction

This is the first project in the course of Deep Learning at Udacity

The project uses historical data for bike-sharing to predict number of renters daily 

The project implements **forward/backward propagation**, **sigmoid** function , and MSE(mean of square error) function.
